<p><b><I><u>Introduction:-</b></I></u>
Traditionally Raksha Bandhan is a festival to commemorate purity and protection in human relationships, especially focusing on the brother-sister relationship. The tying of a beautiful decorated sacred thread to a brother’s wrist by his sister is a symbol of her faith and trust in him.  And brothers see it as a promise to guard and protect their sisters against any harm. 

In Brahma Kumaris, this festival has a much deeper, spiritual meaning and significance giving us an opportunity to ponder upon the aspects of our true relationship with the self, relationship with the Divine power/God and also our relationship with the world as a whole. 

In Brahma kumaris, the practice is slightly different. Here an instrument sister (dedicated sister) invokes the divine power and then ties Rakhi/sacred thread on his behalf to one and all, including both men and women (brothers and sisters) as we all are spiritual beings and children of one father.  This festival reminds us of universal brotherhood, since we all are children of one Divine power/supreme soul. 

Raksha Bandhan is a symbol of purity in the relationship of the soul with the self, of its eternal relationship with the divine power/supreme soul and also relationship with other souls. 

Relationship with Self: It is a promise to the self to be a protector of the good with in us from the negativity.  It is a promise to keep a positive and progressive attitude towards the self no matter what life presents and there by heal your own self with this determination.
